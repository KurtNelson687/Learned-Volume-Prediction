Description:
This is a project for CS229 (Machine Learning) by Kurt Nelson and Sam Maticka. The goal is to predict poured volumes from video footage recorded from an iPhone. The repository contains files for processing raw video outputs to extract features used for machine learning (./mfiles/FeatureExtraction/*), and the implementation of machine learning algorithms for both volume prediction as a regression (./mfiles/Regression/*) and classification problem (./mfiles/Classification/*). Also included is a project write up (and Latex files), which gives details on experimental setup, image processing, and the machine learning algorithms tested. Please refernce it for furhter details. 

We also note the Feature extraction scripts require raw video footage as an input. Due to file sizes, the recorded videos are not included in this repository. If desired, please contact either Kurt or Sam.
